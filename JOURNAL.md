## 10/11/2025 - Finding Parts  

Today, I began finding the parts on Aliexpress which I would need for the build. This took a while for me as I had to change the microcontroller many times for features like BLE, low cost and space. In the end I decided to go with an ESP32-S3 SuperMini, MAX4466 and a 3 AA Battery Holder(I already have). Next step is to plan out the wiring. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0781852768522c5154de32697f40fbb69652cc7d/image.png)
