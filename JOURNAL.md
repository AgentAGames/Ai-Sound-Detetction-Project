This is my journal of the design and building process of **AI Sound Detection Macro**.

## 10/11/2025 - Finding Parts  

Today, I came up with the idea of making an AI sound/phrase detection macro. I began finding the parts on Aliexpress which I would need for the build. This took a while for me as I had to change the microcontroller many times for features like BLE, low cost and space. In the end I decided to go with an ESP32-S3 SuperMini, MAX4466 and a 3 AA Battery Holder(I already have). Next step is to plan out the wiring. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0781852768522c5154de32697f40fbb69652cc7d/image.png)
  

## 10/12/2025 - Changed the mic and planned the wiring  

Today, I realized the MAX4466 wasn’t ideal for my project as it was an analog mic, so I swapped it out for the INMP441 I2S microphone. After rewiring, I quickly made a wiring diagram using Google Slides to keep track of connections(kinda messy). Additionally, while making the wiring diagram I realized that I would have to take out the battery after every use. To solve this issue, I went with idea of making a DIY switch with a wooden clothespin to save cost. The next step is to write firmware code in c++. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--da1f916d2525f9143876ad416d2ba74a17a1044c/image.png)
  

## 10/14/2025 - Planned the Wiring  

Today, I first got the bare bones of my code done by creating a function that inputs a key, such as "E," whenever the AI detects a specific phrase. Then, I headed over to Edge Impulse to train the AI model to recognize the phrases I wanted. The website’s navigation was a bit tricky at first, but the tutorial helped me understand what each tab does. My goal is to train the model to recognize 20+ phrases, but so far I have only trained it on three phrases to test the system. Later, I plan to add the remaining phrases. After training the AI model, I exported the file and updated my code so that it points to the same directory as the exported file. I also had to adjust the detection logic in my code to ensure that it correctly triggers the keypress when the model recognizes a phrase. All thats left to do is to organize my repo and submit!
