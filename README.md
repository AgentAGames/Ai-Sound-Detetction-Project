# **SACRO - Sound Macro**

This project was inspired to me by my little brother who plays the infamous game on **Roblox, Steal a Brainrot**. Basically, the purpose of this project is to input the keypress "**E**" when ever the microphone detects the phrase of a special brainrot. 

Later on, I'll most likely adjust the code to also fit my needs such as quickly opening up my favourite game, opening youtube, etc. For now, the AI module is trained to recognize three phrases from Steal a Brainrot, with the code written to press E whenever one of them is detected.

### **Recreational Purposes**
To use this build for your own purposes you can use use the wiring diagram I made however you'll certainly want to be changing the code, unless your using this for steal a brainrot aswell. Addtionally, you will also have to train your own AI Model and import it with your code. Personally, I find using Edge Impulse a good tool to train your AI Model as I was able to make it familliarize with 3 phrases in under 15 minutes with the help of the tutorial.

### **Note**: Keep in mind how much space (KB) your code requires, since the ESP32 S3 Supermini doesnâ€™t have a large amount of storage.
