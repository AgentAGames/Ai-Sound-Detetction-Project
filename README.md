This project was inspired to me by my little brother who plays the infamous game on Roblox, Steal a Brainrot. Basically, the purpose of this project is to input the keypress "E" when ever the microphone detects the phrase of a special brainrot. Later on, I'll most likely adjust the code to also fit my needs such as quickly opening up my favourite game, opening youtube, etc. For now, the AI module is trained to recognize three phrases from Steal a Brainrot, with the code written to press E whenever one of them is detected.
